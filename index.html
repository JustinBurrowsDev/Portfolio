            I am Justin Burrows, a self-taught Web Developer. For as long as I can remember web development has always captured my interest, in a way I think knowing these skills is like having superpowers. The expression on someone's face when I over-deliver really
            brightens up my day. I love the creative process, and seemly turning nothing into something right out of thin air.

                I started learning how to code back 2014, mainly out of curiosity. This curiosity fostered some experience in designing web applications. Although I am familiar with a few common programming concepts I'm earger to learn and try something new and have
                always been captivated by new and progressive technologies.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
                Design is an ongoing process and can always be improve. Typically I like to keep things simple and clean so the end-user doesn't get distracted from why they came to the website in the first place. However, I love exploring new design possibilities and
                collaborating with other designers. It brings me great joy when my end users finds the user interface aesthetically pleasing.
